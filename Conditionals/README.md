<h3> Conditional Operators </h3>
<ul>
<li> &gt; Greater than <br> </li>
<li> &lt;= Greater than or equal to <br> </li>
<li> < Less than <br> </li>
<li> <= Less than or equal to <br> </li>
<li> == Equality, comparing the values on the left and right <br> </li>
<li> != Not equal to <br> </li>
</ul>

<h3> if/elif Statements </li>

Programmers have the power to determine how they want a program to execute given certain circumstances using if/elif statements. 

However, a big thing with these statements is optimization and conditional flowcharts. As exemplified in compare.py, using elif statements answers questions much earlier in a program and thus speeds up execution time. Take a look at the two conditional flowcharts:
