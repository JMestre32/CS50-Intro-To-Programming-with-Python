<h3> Conditional Operators </h3>
<ul>
<li> &gt; Greater than <br> </li>
<li> &lt;= Greater than or equal to <br> </li>
<li> < Less than <br> </li>
<li> <= Less than or equal to <br> </li>
<li> == Equality, comparing the values on the left and right <br> </li>
<li> != Not equal to <br> </li>
</ul>

<h3> if/elif Statements </li> </h3>

Programmers have the power to determine how they want a program to execute given certain circumstances using if/elif statements. 

However, a big thing with these statements is optimization and conditional flowcharts. As exemplified in compare.py, using elif statements answers questions much earlier in a program and thus speeds up execution time. Take a look at the two conditional flowcharts:

<!-- Quick note:
I was able to put screenshots in the github repository by 
1. first adding them to a folder
2. Going to issues in github repo
3. Clicking 'New issue'
4. Dragging my image into the write textbox
5. Copying the code that github generates
6. Pasting it here>
