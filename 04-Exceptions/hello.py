print("hello, world")
      
      #To fix the error above, add a quotation at the end of the string
#In the video, the synax error is "unterminated string literal"

#My syntax error says "EOL while scanning string literal" which basically
#means the same thing, the string was not closed and the program reached
#it's end. 

#A literal is something YOU typed
