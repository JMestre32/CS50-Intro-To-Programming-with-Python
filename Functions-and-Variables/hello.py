#Notice the '=' sign. That is the assignment operator.
#Also notice that there is a ' ' space after the ?, this is for formatting reasons.
#We don't want the user's input to be typed right next to the ? like so "?Jacob"

name = input("What's your name? ")  

#The '+' sign concatenates the string and user input. 
print("hello, " + name) 

#You can also use a ',' to print the same thing. Like so:
print("hello,", name)

#In this case, we don't need to add an extra space in front of the first string "hello,". 
#The comma does it for us.
