#Notice the '=' sign. That is the assignment operator.
#Also notice that there is a ' ' space after the ?, this is for formatting reasons.
#We don't want the user's input to be typed right next to the ? like so "?Jacob"
name = input("What's your name? ")  
#The '+' sign concatenates the string and user input. 
print("hello, " + name)
