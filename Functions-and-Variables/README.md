Functions are like an action or verb that let you do something in the program. Most programming languages come with built-in functions that allow programmers to "do things". <br/>

We see in the hello.py file that print is a function that allows us to print words to the terminal. 


Errors in your code are called <strong>bugs</strong>. Throughout this course, we will come across several bugs. Do not worry! By the end of this course, we will be equipped with the necessary tools to debug properly. 


<strong>Variables</strong> allow users to assign values to things. This is seen in hello.py through the "name" variable. 

<strong>Comments</strong> allow users to inform readers what their code does or perhaps write pseudocode to help in figuring out how to get code to work. Compilers ignore comments.
